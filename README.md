<h1>Maze Generation and Pathfinder Algorithm</h1>

 ### [Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/aD9REb_An1U)

<h2>Description</h2>
This program allows users to visualize the creation and completion of a maze. Once the program has been initialized and the maze
is displayed, the user can choose to conduct either a Breadth-First-Search or a Depth-First-Search to complete the maze, as algorithms
designed for the completion of both have been implemented within the program. The search's progress is tracked and highlighted in cyan,
while the final result is displayed in blue. The user may choose to create a new maze or begin a new search at any time.

<h2>External Dependencies</h2>
The JAR files contained in the Reference_Libraries directory must first be installed as dependencies
so that the program may compile.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Java</b>

<h2>Environments Used</h2>
